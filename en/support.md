## Frequently Asked Questions

### Gameplay Related

**Q: How do I start a game?**

**Q: What's the difference between game modes?**
A:
- **Random Mode**: The position of the boom candy is randomly generated by the system
- **Manual Mode**: The position of the boom candy is manually specified by the player (suitable for one person controlling all positions)

A: You can view historical game records in the Settings page, including game date, number of players, winner, and other information.
